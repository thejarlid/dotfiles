# Dotfiles

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run
multiple times.

For the color scheme to look right, you will also need terminal-specific
support. I use iterm2 with the profiles in this repo

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.

I recommend cloning this repo into `$HOME/.dotfiles`
